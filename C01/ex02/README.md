# ex02: ft_swap

**Goal:** Swap the values of two integers.

- **Prototype:** `void ft_swap(int *a, int *b);`
- **Allowed functions:** None.
- **How it works:**
  - Uses a temporary variable to swap the values pointed to by `a` and `b`.

**Example usage:**
```c
int a = 1, b = 2;
ft_swap(&a, &b);
// a is now 2, b is now 1
```
