# Checkmate (check_mate)

## Problem
Given a chessboard with pieces, determine if the king is in check.

## Example
Input: 8x8 board as array of strings
Output: "Success" or "Fail"

## Key Concepts
- 2D array parsing
- Piece movement logic

## Sample Solution
```c
// Full implementation is complex; see examshell for details.
// Key steps:
// 1. Parse board, find king position
// 2. For each piece, check if it can attack king
// 3. Output result
```

## Edge Cases
- No king (undefined)
- Multiple kings (undefined)
